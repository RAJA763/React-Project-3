Hogenakkal is a sight to behold in the rain, as the Kaveri comes alive and usually floods her banks. While adventure enthusiasts and adrenaline junkies' throng Hogenakkal in the monsoon, it is not recommended for tourists as the currents are too strong to swim in. Boating is not allowed either, or there is no standard means of transportation to reach the waterfalls. It is best to avoid the river, as the water flow may be too heavy. Further downhill, you can go rafting if you prefer, although discretion is advised. The waterfalls are a sight to behold, as they live up to their name of the 'Smoking Rocks - the sultry mist as the water strikes the rocks covers the base in a myriad of colors. Rainbows adorn the falls, and the scene is postcard perfect."
